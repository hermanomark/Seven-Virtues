		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Temperance is defined as moderation or voluntary self-restraint. It is typically described in 
		terms of what an individual voluntarily refrains from doing. This includes restraint from 
		retaliation in the form of non-violence and forgiveness, restraint from arrogance in the form of 
		humility and modesty, restraint from excesses such as splurging now in the form of prudence, and 
		restraint from excessive anger or craving for something in the form of calmness and self-control.
		</p>
		<p>
		Temperance has been described as a virtue by religious thinkers, philosophers, and more recently, 
		psychologists, particularly in the positive psychology movement. In classical iconography, 
		the virtue is often depicted as a woman holding two vessels transferring water from one to another. 
		It was one of the cardinal virtues in western thought found in Greek philosophy and Christianity, 
		as well as eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism.
		</p>
		<p>
		Temperance is one of the six virtues in the positive psychology classification, included with 
		wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, and transcendence.It is generally characterized as the 
		control over excess, and expressed through characteristics such as chastity, modesty, 
		humility, self-regulation, forgiveness and mercy; each of these involves restraining an 
		excess of some impulse, such as sexual desire, vanity, or anger.
