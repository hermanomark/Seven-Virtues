		<h2> Description:</h2>
		<p> 
		In Christian theology charity, Latin caritas, is understood by Thomas Aquinas as 
		"the friendship of man for God", which "unites us to God". He holds it as "the most excellent 
		of the virtues". Further, Aquinas holds that "the habit of charity extends not only to the love 
		of God, but also to the love of our neighbor".
		</p>
		<p>
		The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines "charity" as "the theological virtue by which 
		we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God".
		</p>
		<p>
		The phrase Deus caritas est from 1 John 4:8—or Θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν (Theos agapē estin) in the original 
		Greek is translated in the King James Version as: "God is love", and in the Douay-Rheims bible as: 
		"God is charity" (1 John 4:8). Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity with "love", 
		which he holds as a passion, not a virtue. The King James Version uses both the words charity 
		and love to translate the idea of caritas/ἀγάπη (agapē): sometimes it uses one, then sometimes 
		the other, for the same concept. Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; 
		instead, throughout they use the same more direct English word love. Love can have other meanings 
		in English, but as used in the New Testament it almost always refers to the virtue of caritas.
		<p>
		Many times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to "love of God", 
		which is a spiritual love that is extended from God to man and then reflected by man, who is made 
		in the image of God, back to God. God gives man the power to act as God acts (God is love), 
		man then reflects God's power in his own human actions towards others. One example of this 
		movement is "charity shall cover the multitude of sins" (1 Peter 4:8), which forms the basis 
		of perfect contrition.
