		<h2> Description:</h2>
		<p>
		Humility is the quality of being humble. Dictionary definitions accentuate humility as a low 
		self-regard and sense of unworthiness.[1] In a religious context humility can mean a recognition 
		of self in relation to a deity (i.e.God) or deities, and self-debasement with subsequent submission 
		to said deity as a member of that religion. Outside of a religious context, humility is defined 
		as being "unselved" a liberation from consciousness of self, a form of temperance 
		that is neither having pride (or haughtiness) nor indulging in self-deprecation. The materialistic 
		view characterizes humility as self-restraint that frees oneself from vanity.
		</p>
		<p>
		Humility is an outward expression of an appropriate inner, or self, regard and is contrasted with 
		humiliation which is an imposition, often external, of shame upon a person. 
		Humility may be misappropriated as ability to suffer humiliation through self-denouncements 
		which in itself remains focus on self rather than low self-focus.
		Humility, in various interpretations, is widely seen as a virtue which centers on low 
		self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many religious and 
		philosophical traditions, it contrasts with narcissism, hubris and other forms of pride 
		and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.

		The term "humility" comes from the Latin word humilitas, a noun related to the adjective humilis, which may be translated as 
		"humble", but also as "grounded", or "from the earth", since it derives from humus (earth). See the English humus.
		The word "humble" may be related to feudal England where the lowest cuts of meat, or 'umbles',' 
		that is to say whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen. 
		The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station may derive from this definition.
